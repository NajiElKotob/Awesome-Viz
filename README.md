Data Visualization

{Awesome Works in Progress}

## Visuals

### Comparison
#### By Category
_Presents specific data across different categories in a stacked or clustered format._
* Bar and Column charts – Excellent for comparing values across different categories. Bar charts (horizontal) are particularly useful when category names are long, while column charts (vertical) are better suited for a smaller number of categories.
* Radar Chart (aka Spider, Web, Star, Cobweb)

#### Over time
_Presents trends over time._
* Line chart (aka Line graph or Line plot) – Best for showing trends over time, especially when you have many data points. They are useful for tracking changes in one or more series of data.
* Slope chart
* Stream graph (aka ThemeRiver)
* Candlestick chart

### Statistical Process Control (SPC)
* XmR chart (Individuals and Moving Range chart) - Monitors individual data points and their moving range.
* Xbar-R chart (Mean and Range chart) - Monitors the process mean and range of subgroups.
* Xbar-S chart (Mean and Standard Deviation chart) - Monitors the process mean and standard deviation of subgroups.
* p-chart (Proportion Defective chart) - Monitors the proportion of defective items in a sample.
* np-chart (Number of Defectives chart) - Monitors the number of defective items in a sample.
* c-chart (Defects per Unit chart) - Monitors the number of defects per unit in a sample.
* u-chart (Defects per Inspection Unit chart) - Monitors the number of defects per inspection unit in a sample.

### Correlation
* Scatter chart (aka scatterplot, scatter graph, scattergram, scatter diagram)
* Bubble chart
* Heat Map (aka Heat Table, Density Table)

### Distribution
* Histogram (aka Frequency Distribution Chart)
* Box Plots (aka Box and Whisker, Boxplot) 
  * [Understanding and interpreting box plots](https://www.wellbeingatschool.org.nz/information-sheet/understanding-and-interpreting-box-plots) - wellbeingatschool.org.nz
  * Tip! Rotate = Normal distribution
* Violin Plot
  * Tip! Violin = Box Plot + Mirrored KDE Plot 
### Part to whole (Simple compositions)
_shows the relationship of parts to the whole by dividing the data into segments._
* Pie chart
* Donut chart
* Treemap
  * _Uses rectangles to visualizes the proportions between each part and the whole. The rectangles are arranged in size from top left (largest) to bottom right (smallest)._
* Coxcomb chart


### Spacial
* Choropleth map (aka Heat Map, Filled Map, Thematic Map, Statistical Map)
* Bubble map
* Tile Grid map
* Shape map

### Flow
* Funnel charts
* Chord chart (aka Radial network diagram, Chord layout, Dependency wheel)
* Sankey

### Single (Present single values)
* Card – Ideal for displaying single, critical metrics such as total sales or current year revenue. They provide a clear and concise summary of a key value at a glance.

### Tables
* Table
* Matrix
