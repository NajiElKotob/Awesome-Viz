Data Visualization

{Awesome Works in Progress}

## Visuals

### Comparison
#### By Category
`Presents specific data across different categories in a stacked or clustered format.`
* Bar and Column charts ‚Äì Excellent for comparing values across different categories. Bar charts (horizontal) are particularly useful when category names are long, while column charts (vertical) are better suited for a smaller number of categories.
* Radar Chart (aka Spider, Web, Star, Cobweb)

#### Over time
`Presents trends over time.`
* Line chart (aka Line graph or Line plot) ‚Äì Best for showing trends over time, especially when you have many data points. They are useful for tracking changes in one or more series of data.
* Slope chart
* Stream graph (aka ThemeRiver)
* Candlestick chart
* Warming stripes
  
### Correlation
* Scatter chart ÿßŸÑŸÖÿÆÿ∑ÿ∑ ÿßŸÑÿ®ŸäÿßŸÜŸä ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ®ÿπÿ´ÿ± (aka scatterplot, scatter graph, scattergram, scatter diagram)
* Volcano plot
* Bubble chart
* Heat Map (aka Heat Table, Density Table)

### Distribution
* Histogram (aka Frequency Distribution Chart)
* Box Plots (aka Box and Whisker, Boxplot) 
  * [Understanding and interpreting box plots](https://www.wellbeingatschool.org.nz/information-sheet/understanding-and-interpreting-box-plots) - wellbeingatschool.org.nz
  * Tip! Rotate = Normal distribution
* Violin Plot
  * Tip! Violin = Box Plot + Mirrored KDE Plot
* Dot Plot
* Strip Plot
* Swarm Plot
  - Scatter Plot + Categorical X ‚Üí Dot Plot
  - Dot Plot + Distribution Across Categories ‚Üí Strip Plot
  - Strip Plot + Jittering with Collision Avoidance ‚Üí Swarm Plot
    
### Part to whole (Compositions)
`Shows the relationship of parts to the whole by dividing the data into segments.`
* Pie chart
* Donut chart
* Radial ÿ¥ÿπÿßÿπŸä
* Aster ÿ≤Ÿáÿ±ÿ© ÿßŸÑŸÜÿ¨ŸÖÿ©
* Treemap ŸÖÿÆÿ∑ÿ∑ ŸáŸäŸÉŸÑŸä
  * _Uses rectangles to visualizes the proportions between each part and the whole. The rectangles are arranged in size from top left (largest) to bottom right (smallest)._
* Coxcomb chart
* Waffle plot (aka Grid plot)
* Waterfall (aka flying bricks chart or Mario chart)

### Spacial
* Choropleth map (aka Heat Map, Filled Map, Thematic Map, Statistical Map)
* Bubble map
* Tile Grid map
* Shape map

### Flow
* Funnel charts
* Chord chart (aka Radial network diagram, Chord layout, Dependency wheel)
* Sankey

### Single (Present single values)
* Card ‚Äì Ideal for displaying single, critical metrics such as total sales or current year revenue. They provide a clear and concise summary of a key value at a glance.

### Tables
* Table
* Matrix

### Statistical Process Control (SPC)
`Control Chart (also known as a Shewhart Chart or Process-Behavior Chart). Control charts are widely used in statistical process control to monitor, control, and improve process performance over time.`
* XmR chart (Individuals and Moving Range chart) - Monitors individual data points and their moving range.
* Xbar-R chart (Mean and Range chart) - Monitors the process mean and range of subgroups.
* Xbar-S chart (Mean and Standard Deviation chart) - Monitors the process mean and standard deviation of subgroups.
* p-chart (Proportion Defective chart) - Monitors the proportion of defective items in a sample.
* np-chart (Number of Defectives chart) - Monitors the number of defective items in a sample.
* c-chart (Defects per Unit chart) - Monitors the number of defects per unit in a sample.
* u-chart (Defects per Inspection Unit chart) - Monitors the number of defects per inspection unit in a sample.
