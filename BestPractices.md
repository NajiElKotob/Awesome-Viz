# Best Practices

* Audience, audience, audience
* KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid)
* Keep visuals simple and to understand
* X = Independent Variable; Y = Dependent Variable
* Horizontal Box Plots = Shape of data distribution
* Filled shape = base 0; Unfilled shape = #
* Use a pie chart if you have a total number that can be split up into 2-5 categories (2 to 5 Rule)
* Avoid using legends with a single category
* Gestalt principles
* Dimensions help in defining context + slice and dice our analysis


-----

* The Card chart displays a single number value. 🔢
* The Pie chart shows percentages of values between categories, by dividing the pie into proportional segments (compare parts of a whole, e.g., monthly sales distribution). 🍩
* The Column and Bar charts show values side by side as vertical or horizontal bars, across categories. Mainly used for comparison (quantities of categories or groups) where the users can find out quickly which category is most popular, and which is least. 📊
* The Line chart shows values over a continuous interval. Mainly used to show trends and track changes over time. It supports multiple data series to compare values and trends (trends over time and the relationship between two or more variables). 📈
* The Pivot Table displays data as a table with a hierarchy of rows and columns.
* Combo chart combines a Column chart displaying the first measure (e.g. Sales revenue) and a Line chart displaying a second measure (Quantity). Each measure is configured on a separate Y-axis. 📈 + 📊
* The Treemap shows a hierarchy of categories/sub-categories and weight for each category via area size. 🌳
* Scatter chart is useful for determining the relationship/correlation between two variables. Variables are correlated if they move together.
* A bubble map uses circles of different size to represent a numeric value on a location. 🗺
* The histogram chart represents the distribution of continuous variables over a given interval. It presents data by splitting it into intervals known as bins. These bins are consecutive and non-overlapping.
