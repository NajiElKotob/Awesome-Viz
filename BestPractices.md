# Best Practices

* Audience, audience, audience
* KISS (Keep it Simple, Stupid)
* Keep visuals simple and to understand
* X = Independent Variable; Y = Dependent Variable
* Horizontal Box Plots = Shape of data distribution
* Filled shape = base 0; Unfilled shape = #
* Use a pie chart if you have a total number that can be split up into 2-5 categories (2 to 5 Rule)
* Avoid using legends with a single category
* Gestalt principles

-----

* The Card chart displays a single number value.
* The Pie chart shows percentages of values between categories, by dividing the pie into proportional segments.
* The Column and Bar charts show values side by side as vertical or horizontal bars, across categories. Mainly used for comparison where the users can find out quickly which category is most popular, and which is least.
* The Line chart shows values over a continuous interval. Mainly used to show trends and track changes over time. It supports multiple data series to compare values (relationships between variables) and trends.
* The Pivot Table displays data as a table with a hierarchy of rows and columns.
* Combo chart combines a Column chart displaying the first measure (e.g. Sales revenue) and a Line chart displaying a second measure (Quantity). Each measure is configured on a separate Y-axis.
* The Treemap shows a hierarchy of categories/sub-categories and weight for each category via area size.
